## File Structure

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py                      # Flask server and Socket.IO handlers
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ online_chess_board.py       # Chess board logic for web version
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ chess_pieces.py             # Chess piece classes and movement rules

## Deployment Options

### Local Network
Run the server and access it from any device on your local network:
```bash
python app.py
# Access via http://YOUR_IP:5000
```

### Public Deployment
Deploy to platforms like:
- **Heroku**: Easy deployment with git integration
- **PythonAnywhere**: Simple Python hosting
- **DigitalOcean**: VPS hosting with more control
- **AWS/GCP**: Cloud platforms for scalability

### Docker Deployment
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
EXPOSE 5000
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

## Features in Detail

### Real-time Communication
- **WebSocket Connection**: Instant bidirectional communication
- **Room-based Architecture**: Players join specific game rooms
- **Event-driven Updates**: Board state, moves, and game events
- **Connection Management**: Handles joins, leaves, and disconnections

### Game State Management
- **Server Authority**: All game logic runs on the server
- **Move Validation**: Prevents cheating and invalid moves
- **Turn Management**: Enforces proper turn-based gameplay
- **Game Over Detection**: Checkmate, stalemate, and draw conditions

### User Experience
- **Intuitive Controls**: Simple click-to-move interface
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indicators for selected pieces and valid moves
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages and recovery

## Security Considerations

- **Server-side Validation**: All moves validated on the server
- **Room Isolation**: Players can only affect their own game
- **Input Sanitization**: Game codes and moves are validated
- **Connection Security**: WebSocket connections with CORS protection

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Connection Failed**: Check if server is running and port is open
2. **Game Code Invalid**: Ensure code is exactly 6 characters
3. **Opponent Not Joining**: Check if game code was shared correctly
4. **Moves Not Working**: Ensure it's your turn and move is valid

### Port Issues
If port 5000 is already in use, modify the last line in `app.py`:
```python
socketio.run(app, debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=5001)
```

## Future Enhancements

- **Spectator Mode**: Allow others to watch games
- **Game History**: Save and replay games
- **Timer Support**: Add chess clocks
- **Rating System**: Track player ratings
- **Tournament Mode**: Bracket-style tournaments
- **Custom Themes**: Different board and piece styles
